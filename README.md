<p><b>A repository for exploit development learners.</b><br>
<b>Pre-requisites</b>: C programming</p>
<p>First of all, one should know how a computer executes binaries
Initially, a programmer writes a code which is human readable.<br> Computers does not understand our code directly, thats why compilers help us to convert the human readable code to machine code.<br><br>
  <b>The compilation process:</b><br>
  Human readable code => Preprocessor => Preprocessed code<br>
  Preprocessed code => Compiler => Assembly code<br>
  Assembly code => Assembler => Binary<br>
  Binary => Linkers => Linked binary<br></p>
  
<p><b>Registers:</b>
  A register is a high speed storage area inside the processor. The CPU uses the registers to store data and perform operations such as addition, subtraction etc.
  In x86 architecture, the list of registers are eax, ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi, esp, eip.
  Among those registers, the eip and esp are special.</p>
  
<p><b>The stack:</b>
  A stack is a datastructure which follows Last In First Out(LIFO) and the possible operations in stack are push and pop. It is the area of space allocated by the operating system when the binary is running for storing the variables.
  We can either push a value to the top of the stack or pop a value from the top of the stack.
  The special register esp(Stack Pointer) always point to the top of the stack or in other words, the value of esp is always the address of the top element in the stack.</p>
