# Exploit-development

<b>A repository for exploit development learners.</b><br>
<b>Pre-requisites</b>: C programming</p>
<p>First of all, an exploit developer should know how a computer executes binaries.
Initially, a programmer writes a code which is human readable.<br> A Computer does not understand the code directly, thats why compilers help us to convert the human readable code to machine code.<br><br>
  <b>The compilation process:</b><br>
  Human readable code => Preprocessor => Preprocessed code<br>
  Preprocessed code => Compiler => Assembly code<br>
  Assembly code => Assembler => Binary<br>
  Binary => Linkers => Linked binary<br>
  
<b>Registers:</b><br>
  A register is a high speed storage area inside the processor. The CPU uses the registers to store data and perform operations such as addition, subtraction etc.
  In x86 architecture, the list of registers are eax(accumulator), ebx(base), ecx(counter), edx(data), esi(source index), edi(source destination), esp(stack pointer) , ebp(base pointer), eip(instruction pointer). The size of the register is measured in bits. x86 machines have 32 bit length of registers.<br><br>
  <b>Some units to know:</b><br>
  Bit = Binary digit (it is either one or zero)<br>
  Byte = 8 bits<br>
  Word = The length of the word depends on architecture of the CPU (For instance, 32 bit CPU has word length of 32 bits)<br>
  Dword = 2 words (double word)<br>
  Qword = 4 words (quad word)<br>
  
  
<b>Endianness:</b><br>
  Endianness is primarily expressed in little-endian or big-endian. A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Endianness may also be used to describe the order in which the bits are transmitted over a communication channel, e.g., big-endian in a communications channel transmits the most significant bits first.<br><br>

<b>The stack:</b><br>
  A stack is a datastructure which follows Last In First Out(LIFO) and the possible operations in stack are push and pop. It is the area of space allocated by the operating system when the binary is running for storing the variables.
  We can either push a value to the top of the stack or pop a value from the top of the stack.
  The special register esp(Stack Pointer) always point to the top of the stack or in other words, the value of esp is always the address of the top element in the stack.<br><br>

<b>Assembly language:</b><br>
   Assembly language is a low-level, architecuture dependent programming language. It is a set of instructions which is executed in a sequential order. An exploit developer should atleast have an idea of what an assembly language looks like and how it works. The assembly code is converted into machine code with assemblers.<br><br>
